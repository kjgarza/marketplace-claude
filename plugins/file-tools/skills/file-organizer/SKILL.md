  Organize files and folders by analyzing directory contents, finding duplicates,
  suggesting better structures, and automating cleanup. This skill should be used when
  the user wants to organize files, clean up a folder (Downloads, Desktop, Documents),
  find duplicate files, sort files by type or date, restructure project directories,
  declutter a messy directory, or archive old files.

# File Organizer

Organize files and folders with context-aware analysis, duplicate detection, and automated cleanup.

## Instructions

When a user requests file organization help:

1. **Understand the Scope**
   
   Ask clarifying questions:
   - Which directory needs organization? (Downloads, Documents, entire home folder?)
   - What's the main problem? (Can't find things, duplicates, too messy, no structure?)
   - Any files or folders to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)
   - How aggressively to organize? (Conservative vs. comprehensive cleanup)

2. **Analyze Current State**
   
   Review the target directory:
   ```bash
   # Get overview of current structure
   ls -la [target_directory]
   
   # Check file types and sizes
   find [target_directory] -type f -exec file {} \; | head -20
   
   # Identify largest files
   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20
   
   # Count file types
   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
   ```
   
   Summarize findings:
   - Total files and folders
   - File type breakdown
   - Size distribution
   - Date ranges
   - Obvious organization issues

3. **Identify Organization Patterns**
   
   Based on the files, determine logical groupings:
   
   **By Type**:
   - Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT)
   - Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)
   - Videos (MP4, MOV)
   - Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG)
   - Code/Projects (directories with code)
   - Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)
   - Presentations (PPTX, KEY)
   
   **By Purpose**:
   - Work vs. Personal
   - Active vs. Archive
   - Project-specific
   - Reference materials
   - Temporary/scratch files
   
   **By Date**:
   - Current year/month
   - Previous years
   - Very old (archive candidates)

4. **Find Duplicates**
   
   When requested, search for duplicates:
   ```bash
   # Find exact duplicates by hash
   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \; | sort | uniq -d

   # Find files with same name
   find [directory] -type f -exec basename {} \; | sort | uniq -d

   # Find similar-sized files (macOS)
   find [directory] -type f -exec stat -f '%z %N' {} \; | sort -n
   ```
   
   For each set of duplicates:
   - Show all file paths
   - Display sizes and modification dates
   - Recommend which to keep (usually newest or best-named)
   - **Important**: Always ask for confirmation before deleting

5. **Propose Organization Plan**
   
   Present a clear plan before making changes:
   
   ```markdown
   # Organization Plan for [Directory]
   
   ## Current State
   - X files across Y folders
   - [Size] total
   - File types: [breakdown]
   - Issues: [list problems]
   
   ## Proposed Structure
   
   ```
   [Directory]/
   ├── Work/
   │   ├── Projects/
   │   ├── Documents/
   │   └── Archive/
   ├── Personal/
   │   ├── Photos/
   │   ├── Documents/
   │   └── Media/
   └── Downloads/
       ├── To-Sort/
       └── Archive/
   ```
   
   ## Changes I'll Make
   
   1. **Create new folders**: [list]
   2. **Move files**:
      - X PDFs → Work/Documents/
      - Y images → Personal/Photos/
      - Z old files → Archive/
   3. **Rename files**: [any renaming patterns]
   4. **Delete**: [duplicates or trash files]
   
   ## Files Needing Your Decision
   
   - [List any files you're unsure about]
   
   Ready to proceed? (yes/no/modify)
   ```

6. **Execute Organization**
   
   After approval, organize systematically:
   
   ```bash
   # Create folder structure
   mkdir -p "path/to/new/folders"
   
   # Move files with clear logging
   mv "old/path/file.pdf" "new/path/file.pdf"
   
   # Rename files with consistent patterns
   # Example: "YYYY-MM-DD - Description.ext"
   ```
   
   **Important Rules**:
   - Always confirm before deleting anything
   - Log all moves for potential undo
   - Preserve original modification dates
   - Handle filename conflicts gracefully
   - Stop and ask if you encounter unexpected situations

7. **Provide Summary and Maintenance Tips**
   
   After organizing:
   
   ```markdown
   # Organization Complete! ✨
   
   ## What Changed
   
   - Created [X] new folders
   - Organized [Y] files
   - Freed [Z] GB by removing duplicates
   - Archived [W] old files
   
   ## New Structure
   
   [Show the new folder tree]
   
   ## Maintenance Tips
   
   To keep this organized:
   
   1. **Weekly**: Sort new downloads
   2. **Monthly**: Review and archive completed projects
   3. **Quarterly**: Check for new duplicates
   4. **Yearly**: Archive old files
   
   ## Quick Commands for You
   
   ```bash
   # Find files modified this week
   find . -type f -mtime -7
   
   # Sort downloads by type
   [custom command for their setup]
   
   # Find duplicates
   [custom command]
   ```

## Grouping Strategies

Based on the files found, determine logical groupings:

**By Type**: Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT), Images (JPG, PNG, SVG), Videos (MP4, MOV), Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG), Code/Projects, Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV), Presentations (PPTX, KEY)

**By Purpose**: Work vs. Personal, Active vs. Archive, Project-specific, Reference materials, Temporary/scratch files

**By Date**: Current year/month, Previous years, Very old (archive candidates)
